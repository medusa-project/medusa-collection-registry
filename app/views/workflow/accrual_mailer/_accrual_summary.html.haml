%p
  The pending request for ingest is to transfer all content from the
  source directory #{@workflow_accrual.staging_path}
  to Medusa File Group '#{@workflow_accrual.file_group_title}',
  Collection '#{@workflow_accrual.collection.title}'
  - if @workflow_accrual.collection.external_id.present?
    [#{@workflow_accrual.collection.external_id}]
  at the destination
  file path #{@workflow_accrual.relative_target_path}.

%p
  If approved, #{@workflow_accrual.directory_count} folders and
  #{@workflow_accrual.top_level_file_count} top level files
  containing a total of #{@workflow_accrual.total_accrual_key_count} files
  (#{number_to_human_size(@workflow_accrual.size)})
  would transfer to the destination path above.

%p
  An abbreviated view of the new file structure, to verify this ingest
  will arrive at the right place, would be:

%ul
  %li
    #{@workflow_accrual.relative_target_path}
    %ul
      - @workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_directories.order(:name).limit(5).each do |directory|
        %li [folder] #{directory.name}
      - if @workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_directories.count > 5
        %li ([#{@workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_directories.count - 5}] more sibling folders in ingest)
    %ul
      - @workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_files.order(:name).limit(5).each do |file|
        %li [file] #{file.name}
      - if @workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_files.count > 5
        %li ([#{@workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_files.count - 5}] more sibling files in ingest)

- if @workflow_accrual.empty_file_report.present?
  %div
    Some zero size files were detected in the ingest request
    %pre
      = @workflow_accrual.empty_file_report

- if @workflow_accrual.unsafe_characters_report.present?
  %div
    Some unsafe characters were detectd in the ingest request
    %pre
      @workflow_accrual.unsafe_characters_report

%p
  If this seems incorrect, please take a close look at source and
  destination files before proceeding.

%p
  Medusaâ€™s pre-ingest scan detects #{@workflow_accrual.workflow_accrual_conflicts.serious.count}
  md5 conflicts in this request.
  %br
  %em A duplicate key in a no-overwrites accrual is regarded as a serious conflict, although no md5 check is performed.
